**Tesserax** comes with a powerful procedural animation system that renders animated GIF or MP4 videos. To enable it, you need to install it with the `tesserax[export]` to download the appropriate dependencies.

::: {.callout-note}
You can use the animation framework without the `export` extra to build the animations, and export a sequence of SVG files to stitch them on your own.

The first step to create an animation is to construct a `Scene` object attached to your `Canvas`. With that, you can manually capture snapshots of the whole canvas, and render the final sequence proceduraly.

```{python}
import math
from tesserax import Canvas, Rect
from tesserax.animation import Scene

# 1. Build
with Canvas() as canvas:
    back = Rect(100, 100, fill="white")
    rect = Rect(50, 50, fill="orange")

# 2. Animate
scene = Scene(canvas, fps=30)
for i in range(60):
    rect.rotated(360 / 60)
    canvas.align().fit()
    scene.capture()

# 3. View inline
scene.save("example.gif")
```
